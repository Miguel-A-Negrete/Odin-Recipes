    <p>Friday night often is pizza and salad night at our house, and dinner prep for these pizza boats doesn't get much easier. <br>
        Each roll half can be customized to keep everybody happy, so allow them to choose their favorite toppings.
         <br> One time it may be pepperoni and tomatoes, then next time might be sausage, onions, meatballs, roasted peppers, olives, or bacon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8-inch) hoagie rolls</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>8 grape tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). <br> Place a piece of aluminum foil on a baking sheet; set aside. </p></li>
        <li><p>Slice each hoagie roll in half lengthwise to form two rolls, and using your fingertips, hollow out some of the bread inside, forming a well.
             <br> Lightly brush each roll with olive oil, and sprinkle with Italian seasoning. </p></li>
        <li><p>Fill and spread each roll with 1/4 cup pizza sauce and then top with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. 
            <br> Layer pepperoni and grape tomatoes on top of the cheese, sprinkle with red pepper flakes, and season to taste with salt. Place rolls on the prepared baking sheet.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is turning golden brown and starting to bubble, 12 to 14 minutes. Serve warm. </p></li>
